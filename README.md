# Databases
## A repository that hosts the work/projects I completed during the course "Databases" of the Informatics Department in Athens University of Economics and Business.

The repo includes relatively simple SQL queries that I wrote to complete assignment tasks, in Microsoft Azure, filtering and producing simple result of a Movie Dataset.
